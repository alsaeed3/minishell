It was a group project, where me and my partner Hisham worked together to accomplish the goal of remaking bash as required by 42 network.
It allows the use of built-in functions and executable commands of bash as a single command or piped commands, with returning the status code of executing of the commands success or failure using $? s as bash.
It's also allowing the use of signals like ctrl + c for SIGINT and ctrl + d for EOF.
